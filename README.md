# What Language I used
I used Python through Spyder Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using Keras and Tensorflow as backend.

# Description
This project was created for the purpose of taking a picture of a banana and then classifying it as either yellow, green or black using convolutional neural network while also connecting it to an app which would be able to predict when the banana should be ready for pickup. The goal of this project was to help farmers know when their crops are ready and also to prevent food wastage by not allowing fruits to reach to the point where they go rotten.
